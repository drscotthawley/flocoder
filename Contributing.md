# Contributing to flocoder

Thanks for your interest in contributing. There are many ways to make improvments..
- upgrading UNet / attention / MM-DiT
- replacing "jank" and "code smell" with robust, elegant routines
- adding tests & documentation
- fixing buigs
- addressing other "TODOs" 

You may wonder why something is implemented a certain way, and I suspect it was done so because it was expedient at the time. 
- Your idea is probably better than the current implemetnation - submit a PR
- Your tests, documentation, and/or CI workflow(s) would be greatly appreciated -- submit a PR

Before submitting a PR, take a look at the coding [Style Guide](StyleGuide.md) to see that new code is compliant. 

When submitting the PR, do so as a new branch (rather than `main`) to make it easy to track and manage. 

Thank you!
